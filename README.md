# whilelooplaundry


This is an assignment for my bootcamp. I made it a little more complex by importing time, and create a time.sleep principle which added a delay in between each shirt being folded.

I ran into some trouble with checking if the users input for folding time was a float/int, and had to look up the answer. In the end, I found that if we use while loop with try/except, we can check if the
users input is a float. I am slightly (not slightly( majorly) confused on the while True idea and why it should be used here so I might dig more into that and find some loop exercises to do.

Anyways, thanks for reading and checking this out!

Scenario Assigned:
Imagine you're creating a program to simulate folding laundry.

Write a Python script that uses a while loop to simulate folding five (5) shirts. Your code should:

Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of shirts folded
Use a while loop to "fold" shirts until five are folded
Print a message for each shirt folded
Print a final message when all shirts are folded
